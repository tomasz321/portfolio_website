                      I started my journey in IT as a data analyst intern, I was responsible for analysing large datasets
                      comming from autonomus vehicles. After two months I was promoted to a Junior Data Science Engineer,
                      and after another two months I became a Regular Data Science Engineer. Durin those few months,
                      I was mostly working with Python and focusing on automating as much of repetitive work as possible.
                      After eight months I was promoted to a Product Owner position, I was responsible for machine learning
                      team, focusing on implementing object, traffic signs and lines detection and tracking.

                      During my time in Diet-AI I was responsible for implementing knowledge-based recommendation system
